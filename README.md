# Women’s Mentoring Network - Integrated Data Management & Digital Modernization Using AI

## Project Overview

This project aims to solve a database and documentation consolidation issue occurring within a local nonprofit through merging existing physical and digital documents using a composite ID that contains:

- an auto-generated client ID
- First & Last Name with Middle Initial
- Birthdate
- City and State
- Phone Number

The composite ID will unite scattered information across different locations into one centralized Client Database, allowing staff to view client progress, client metrics, and the organization’s KPIs and details easily.

The project will also attempt address website and marketing limitations such as:

- Outdated site structure and design
- Broken links, missing program descriptions, and non-functional forms
- Spanish-language page formatting errors

Using various convenient and cost effective/free AI integrations and platforms like Visily AI and Claude AI.

All project deliverables were completed between August 4, 2025 at 6:30pm to August 6, 2025 at 5pm when the project was submitted as per the requirements of the **AI for Impact: The NonProfit Challenge Hackathon presented by [the Southwest Connecticut Tech Hub](https://cttechhub.org/) & [the Stamford Partnership](https://stamfordpartnership.org/)**

## Project Breakdown

### Phase 1

Creation of ETL code to be tested against dummy data containing common mistakes present during data entry. Code will be used to address common issues such as duplicates before merging data under a unique client ID.

### Phase 2

* AI integration of existing products to streamline consolidation. The organization uses Microsoft 365 and DropBox separately. DropBox has a free integration with Microsoft 365 as well as AI tools to assist with organization.
  
* Utilization of [Visily AI](https://www.visily.ai/) to create modern upgraded mock up of the August 2025 version of the Women's Mentoring Network's website that solves concerns with accessibility and provides a more intuitive website user interface.

### Phase 3

Present deliverables and MVP demo to nonprofit stakeholders at the Synchrony Skills Academy in Stamford, CT on August 7, 2025.
